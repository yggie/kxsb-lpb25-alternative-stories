    "context": "# The Scene: Speaker’s Corner, Hyde Park - Late Afternoon\n\nThe air is thick with the buzz of a Sunday afternoon at Speaker's Corner. A small crowd has gathered around Evelyn Hart, a charismatic activist known for her fiery speeches on women's rights and social justice. Alex Turner, the indie musician, sits casually nearby, observing the scene with an amused expression, occasionally strumming his guitar softly. Dr. Amelia Hartley, a local historian, stands slightly apart, taking notes and looking thoughtful. The light is fading, casting long shadows across the grass.\n\nThe player joins the group chat after Evelyn’s speech concludes.",
