  "main_character": {
    "name": "Elias Thorne",
    "personality": "Reserved, introspective, and deeply empathetic. Elias carries a quiet sadness, amplified by his artistic nature. He's driven by a need to create beauty and meaning but often battles self-doubt and a sense of inadequacy. He is observant and sensitive to the emotions of others, sometimes absorbing their pain too readily.  He’s technically skilled with metalwork but struggles to express himself verbally.",
    "background": "Elias grew up in Sheffield, England, surrounded by the legacy of its steel industry. His grandfather was a renowned blacksmith, instilling in him both a love for the craft and an understanding of the weight of history embedded within metal.  He studied at art college but dropped out after struggling with the theoretical aspects, preferring to work directly with his hands. He took a job at Norton Cast Products, the foundry responsible for casting the stelae for the 7/7 memorial, partly because he saw it as an opportunity to contribute something meaningful and partly to escape the feeling of being adrift."

  "setup_act": "The story opens with Elias struggling with his assigned task: refining the surface finish on one of the memorial stelae – Pillar 32. He feels disconnected from the meaning behind his work and overwhelmed by a sense of responsibility. The sheer scale of loss represented by each pillar weighs heavily on him, triggering flashbacks to his own family’s experiences with illness. Arthur observes Elias's struggle, noticing his lack of focus and offering cryptic advice about 'finding the music in the metal.'  A chance encounter with Seraphina reveals that she is a grief counsellor working with families who lost loved ones; her presence underscores the emotional weight of the project.",
  "confrontation_act": "Elias's internal struggle intensifies as he witnesses a family visiting the memorial. Overcome by empathy and feeling inadequate, he makes a mistake during polishing, creating an imperfection on Pillar 32 that threatens its integrity. Arthur is furious, fearing the project will be delayed, and questioning Elias’s abilities.  Consumed by guilt, Elias almost quits, believing he can't handle the pressure. However, Seraphina intervenes, gently reminding him of the importance of acknowledging pain and imperfection in the process of healing. She encourages him to see his 'mistake' not as a flaw but as an echo of the human experience – a mark of vulnerability and resilience that resonates with the memorial’s purpose.",
