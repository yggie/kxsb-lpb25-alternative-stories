You will be provided with a brief that lays out the background for the game. From this brief, write a suitable introductory act to introduce the characters and the background. This document is meant to guide writers to develop the story further, so avoid including any detailed character dialogue. The act is also meant to be short, so avoid developing the story too much and focus on simply introducing the world. Write the full specifications, along with providing a proposed title for this act.

If provided with information about the previous act, ensure that this act builds on that story towards any one of the specific endings.
{extra_act_instructions}

In addition, include a small section which includes text meant to open the act for players. This should be a sequence of short sentences, which will be shown to the player like a prologue in films.

Your response should only include the content in strictly JSON format. An example of a response:

```
{ "title": "Act 1", "document": "In this act...", "prologue": ["Once upon a time‚Ä¶", "In a land far, far away"] }

{base_character}

Your job is to create the specifications for a text based game based on the provided materials. You will be provided with the full project brief from which you will have to write the full dialogue of the experience for the players.

The game is played out like an interactive messaging app. The characters defined in the story are all participants of the chat, and they should chat in a way that fits their personality and background including their mannerisms, emotions, spelling quirks and slang. For example, a string of messages written into the chat app from a character could be defined as:

```
Naomi: First message
Naomi: Second message
Naomi: Third message with emoji üòÖ
```

These messages should only include the written messages from the sender, however they may also include emojis when appropriate for the character.

Players can also participate in the conversation by responding with one of multiple dialogue options provided. These options allow the player to inject a bit of their personality into the conversation, but it should be inconsequential to the whole story. To denote player messages, start with an asterisk, with each response option separated by asterisks:

```
*: Response option 1 * Response option 2 * Response option 3
```

For this particular task, you will need to develop the dialogue for a single act in the story, in this case, the introductory act which will be used to build up the world and the characters.

The dialogue be long (at least 30 messages) and slowly tends towards one of the possible endings. Most of these messages should be the dialogue between the characters to help develop the story further. Focus on making the interactions between characters natural, with the player occasionally having a chance to jump into the conversation. All characters in the story should be participating in the dialogue.

Towards the end of the dialogue, the player will be asked to take a photo that will help the story progress. As part of the dialogue, the characters should describe the requirements of the photo that is consistent with the characters and the story. The requirements for the photo should be two criteria from the following list:

- Water
- Grass
- Trees
- Walls
- People
- Flowers
- Sky
- Landmarks

Use the last few messages from the characters to explain this requirement as part of the story to the player (a.k.a ‚ÄúTraveller‚Äù), as they will be the ones completing this task.

{extra_dialogue_instructions}

After the photo is taken, there will be additional dialogue from the characters. Expand on this dialogue assuming the player (Traveller) has met all of their requirements, and include at least 20 messages, with a bit more participation from the player (Traveller). This additional dialogue has the same format as the normal dialogue.

Return your response in strictly JSON format only. For example:

```
{ "dialogue": ["Lewis: What happened?", "Lewis: Was I too late? üòú", "*: No you're fine * I was waiting for so long!" ], "photo_requirements": ["Flowers", "Walls"], "post_photo_dialogue": ["Naomi: That is a great photo!", "* Thanks\n* Thank you" ] }
```
